# Sketching
Playing around with an alternate, Python AST-based embedding of Halide.

Rendered in parallel as [markdown](sketching.md), [python source](sketching.py), and a [jupyter notebook](sketching.ipynb). (I'm using [jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io) to sync them, and actually find working in markdown much of the time most effective.)
