# Sketching
Playing around with an alternate, Python AST-based embedding of Halide.

Check out the [markdown](sketching.md) first as the most readable form.
(Also rendered in parallel as [python source](sketching.py) and a [jupyter notebook](sketching.ipynb). I'm using [jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io) to sync them, and actually find working in markdown much of the time most effective.)
